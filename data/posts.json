    "content": "Starting a blog was one of the most rewarding things I’ve done in my career. As someone who loves writing and connecting with readers, having an outlet to share my thoughts while potentially helping others has been an incredible experience.\r\n\r\nWhen I first began blogging a few years ago, I really had no idea what I was doing. I would just sit down at my computer whenever inspiration struck and write whatever came to mind. Sometimes I would publish posts without even proofreading them because I was so eager to get my ideas out there.\r\n\r\nLooking back now, those early posts were pretty rough. It’s almost cringe-worthy to read some of my early writing. But we all have to start somewhere, right? Even though I made plenty of mistakes (which I’ll detail later in this post), blogging has enabled me to find my voice, create helpful content, and connect with readers from all walks of life.\r\n\r\nIf you’re thinking about starting a blog but feel intimidated or don’t know where to begin, I want this post to encourage you. You don’t have to have everything figured out on day one. I certainly didn’t! Consider this your kick in the pants to just take that first step and start writing.\r\n\r\nAnd to help you avoid some of the early pitfalls I encountered, I’ll take you through a step-by-step guide to learn how to write a great post, drawing from my own experience as well as expert insights from top bloggers. Get ready to take notes!",

    "content": "I still remember being inundated with those ads that promise you it’s “easy” to figure out how to earn by writing articles.\r\n\r\nI didn’t believe them then, and you shouldn’t believe them now, either. It’s not easy to earn money online by writing, certainly not as a beginner.\r\n\r\nBut:\r\n\r\nIt’s easier for writers to earn money than it used to be, because there are lots of places to apply and pitch\r\nCompetition probably isn’t as stiff as you imagine — there are lots of crappy “writers” out there just trying to earn a quick buck",
